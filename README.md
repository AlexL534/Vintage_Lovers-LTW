**Security**:
We have been careful with the following security aspects:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** filtering the inputs give by the user and encoding data we are displaying.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** using tokens to check suspicious activity.

**Password Storage Mechanism**: hash_password&verify_password
